		*** DOINAKRA README ***

	** DESCRIPTION **

Hello everyone !

This is my second game, a (very) simple Arkanoid clone done with SFML2.1 and the
help of _SFML Game Development_, a very nice book for begginners. In facts, at
the end of the first chapter, the authors said that we are capable of creating a
simple game with everything that we've learned so far. I took that as a
challenge and created this little game.

	** DOWNLOAD INSTRUCTIONS **

If you just want to play the game, the binaries for Windows and GNU/Linux 64
bits are provided in bin/.
  - Windows users, take the zipped file which contains the game and the
  libraries used.
  - GNU/Linux users, you will need first to download SFML2.1, as I don't provide
  the necessary dynamic libraries. It is available here:
  http://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.1/

	** COMPILING INSTRUCTIONS **

You want to compile from source? Good. You will first need SFML2.1, available
here: http://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.1/ .

Then, just download the src/ and include/ files and type `make' in the src
directory. The game should compile itself.
